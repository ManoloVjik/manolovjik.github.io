# In that simple projects I wanted to study, with all my sedulity, that new, modern and
# hooliganical programming language - JavaScript and those 
# traditional yet languages - HTML & CSS.
#
# Also I tried to build some simple projects by Arduino and ESP32 boards.
#
# All code was created by me in VSCode - it's great and powerfull instrument for whole circle 
# of programmers - from professionals for nerds. VSCode can work with JS and other languages, 
# and can work with Arduino and ESP scetches! It's so cool and help me so much.
